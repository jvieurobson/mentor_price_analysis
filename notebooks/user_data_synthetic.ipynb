    "Problem: Current startup founders, or wannabe startup founders don't have access to the resources necessary to successfully build their companies.\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to take a hypothetical scenario relevant to the role of a Product Analyst, and perform procedures and analyses that would be relevant to the improvement and development of a product, and the business bottom-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario is as follows:\n",
    "- You are a Product Analyst at a company currently offeringproduct and services in the startup services industry.\n",
    "- You have achieved strong growth since launching X years ago, and now have a user base of X. \n",
    "- You have noticed however, that retention rates are low. \n",
    "   - Retention rates for all learning paths drop significantly after X sessions\n",
    "   - Feedback provided by customers using the app frequently cite that they don't have enough motivation to finish the learning path, and that ....\n",
    "   - Users frequently request customer support, but often this is not due to technical difficulties, but inquiries about the learning path itself (i.e. i'm not sure if i'm supposed to feel anxious while doing this breathing exercise.etc.).\n",
    "- You therefore brainstorm with your team for solutions, and come up with the idea to introduce personal support to users by way of seasoned entrepeneurs and startup founders. The idea is that during their learning path, users will have the option to have a mentor guide them through the process, whether that be through a weekly call, or simply an occasional exchange of messages .\n",
    "- Your business has now just gone from a 1-dimensional B2C business, to a two-sided marketplace model, where you source, vet, and match users with startup mentors to guide them in their learning paths.\n",
    "- In this scenario however, there is no publicly available app data since that is proprietary. Instead, we will rely on the generation of synthetic data to guide the resolution of our hypothetical scenario.\n",
